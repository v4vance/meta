Character customization

 - templated selections of hair, skin, overall looks based on race, etc.
 - allows for deeper interaction
 - maintains thematic integrity
 - pre-set titles (?) options for coloring
 
Multiple characters under one main account

 - toon customization done at the account level, not in-game
 - allows for player rewards based on involvement as a whole
   (less chance for "rogue" attitudes towards the game)
   
Log into your account, which gives general menus and options. No need to play directly.
OOC chat channel available in that space, not in-game.

----

Communication in-game should be as direct as possible.
 - say & semote
 - tells through "aligned stones" or somesuch
 - birds (crows, hawks, doves)
 - faction based channels (horn calls, drums in the deep)
 
Less emphasis on non-local channels while in-game
