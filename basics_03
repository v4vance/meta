Implementing ranged combat in a grid based game

 - find a long range threat
 - lock onto them
 - shoot at them (difficulty increases based on distance)
 - target sees arrows/missiles/darts and direction they are from
 
Game AI divides mobs into Fight or Flee or Hide

Melee should happen in same room, ranged would be hard when melee is initiated.

Wounds create afflictions
Afflictions can incapacite or kill
Ranged combat does less damage compared to melee


Creating defensive tactics that control territory

A character could take a position in certain rooms where they control access
 - "block south" would prohibit access to the south
 
Rooms would have to be defenses identified. Grid rooms would normally be free movement.

Shields would play a larger role for defenders.
- Less opportunity for attack
- As a character's health declines, they can be replaced, then retreat to a safe room for healing, eventually returning
- Ranged combat can then take place behind each line

General game mechanics for combat should set up the idea of area control for group play. 
"Threat" is replaced by defensive positioning backed up by ranged firepower or skirmishing ahead of the battle line.

----
Groups in melee should get offensive or defensive bonuses if they outnumber opponents.
Some opponents could be so big (trolls, etc) that they are assigned a group size (3, 4, 5)
Since they are single targets, they can easily become focused by multiple attackers.
