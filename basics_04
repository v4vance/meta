Other AI considerations/tactics
-----

Mobs assigned as defender can be taunted off of a defensive position, which allows for 
the passage of characters beyond a specific choke point.
Taunting should involve some level of combative involvement or crowd control application.

Example: 
  An archer sets up a trap in a different room, then starts shooting arrows at a wolf that
  is guarding a lair. 
  The wolf gets hit by a couple arrows. Since it is a fight animal, it moves to the archer's
  room to attack, where it gets stuck in the trap.
  The archer moves around the wolf to the lair.
