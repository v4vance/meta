Bree-land Guild: Gatekeepers
Bree is surrounded by a dike and a hedge. The Gatekeepers would have
had to protect the gates, as well as watch over the protecting wall.

Gatekeepers wield bows while patrolling the watchtowers overlooking 
the dike.
Pole-arms would have been used when the gates were breached, mainly 
spears. Armour would have been helmets, reinforced leathers, maybe a
shield. Guards would have used reinforced clubs and daggers for short
range/close combat.
Long spears could be thrust through the hedge.
