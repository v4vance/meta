Character development

The basic premise should be to start out "common" and move to "epic" as the
character completes different feats or quests. Killing should not equate to 
advancement. It should only build fighting prowess and skills.
Certain feats might require killing a number of foes.
 "Defeat 20 brigands as they invade Bree"
 This could be event specific
 
Deed - one time accomplishment
Feat - cumulative accomplishment
Quest - story driven series of deeds and feats

Incorporate "dailies" along with other time or factional resets

For instance, factional turn-in of items pools up to a certain threshold, 
then opens a dungeon/fortress.

Character development points based on account interaction with game,
not random amounts (dice rolls)

Offer names based on available surnames and common first names (tied with
account info for unique use)

Stripping corpses

"Defeat" should be more common and easier to respond to than death. 
Corpse-looting should also take time and energy, as gear that covers a 
person is not always easy to remove.
Corpse looting of all items should be allowed.
A "defeat" should result in a certain amount of unconscious time, then 
revival. Monster AI should strip any gold and one items from a 
defeated body.

Death should separate the fea (spirit) from the body, which can then 
travel as a ghost. Ghosts can be reunited with the body after the 
body is healed. But the body (stats) will suffer penalties. Fea may be 
reduced.
