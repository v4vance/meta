Control of territory means control of resources
-----

Basic mats can be gathered from different areas equally.
Each area has specific crafting mats that are superior to other mats.

So what gets crafted and why?
What are the different factions and what specialties do they craft?

Housing in faction areas
Make homes visitable but not vandalizable. Display items of worth.

Characters can set up the home so that their items are displayed for all to see.

-----

Farming (harvesting crops) is an option in a developed area. Wild areas contain
 more risk, but also give more/varied reward.
