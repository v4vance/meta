Community is the creation and direction of "passive space" as opposed to combat, 
which is the control of "active space".

Crafting creates individual objects that can be traded or kept for personal
identity. Community creates group objects that can be awarded or denied
for interpersonal identity.

Obvious "community" items would be houses or shared improvements. Choice of food
at the inn or standard items at shops. Banks or vaults for community use.

"Soft" items would be families and societies akin to the clan concept seen in
games. These bonds would give greater bonuses to shared endeavors: crafted
items worked on together or healing in combat, etc.

The size and layout of each faction's zones needs to be figured.

General idea: the West is safest and the furthest east is more dangerous
 (at least for new, non-pvp players).
 
Create open (0) zones without factions and then have people develop them or seek
factional control in them.
