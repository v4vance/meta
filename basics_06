Taunting vs Crowd Control
-----

The "trinity" concept uses an AI mechanic to force mobs to attack a character that 
can mitigate damage, either through armor or a large health pool.

This mechanic does not translate into PVP situations: who would purposely attack a
 high HP, high mitigations target that does little damage and provides no group buff?
 
Heavies should control territory: the mechanic should be based on "thou shall not pass!"
 and require the heavy/tank to occupy a position that forces a melee interaction.
If the heavy cannot do this, then the group deserves to suffer. The squishy toons need 
 to develop an awareness of a held position.

So the general mechanic becomes using a defensible position where ranged attacks can
 afflict enemies and then skirmish attacks can kill/defeat them.
 
Defender
Skirmisher (armored/speed  OR stealth)
Ranged afflictor (magic or mundane)
Buffer/healer

These are -combat- tactics
