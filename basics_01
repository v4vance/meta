The following notes were the original ideas written in a Moleskine notebook in 2014/2015

Possible game idea

 - Remort based
 - Factions for lawsys
 - Scavenge < Faction Quest < Crafting
 - Professions/Guilds
   - Create reasons for class interaction
   - Solo play allowed but group play encouraged
 - Advancement creates disparity in skills, not in stats like HP/EP
 - Variable attributes for greater customization
 - MXP oriented channels for separation/colorization
 
Zones are faction controlled
Factions have enemy factions in other zones, plus enemy cells in their zone
Factions have ally factions
Factions can be neutral (towards other factions)

Factions have professions or guilds (?)

You would have to be part of a faction to learn skills, recipes, etc from that faction
 - Bilbo was part of the Rivendell and Erebor factions
 - Both were enemies of the Misty Mtn Goblin faction
 
 Race -> Stats/Attributes
 Faction -> Professions, skills, recipes, items, mounts
 
 Lawsys protects the rights of citizens within faction areas

 Death not allowed in certain areas
 
 "Defeat" in lawsys controlled areas.
 "Death" in wild areas.
 
 "Contested" areas with henchmen and champions that are driven off, not killed.
 Towers that are uninhabited until enough henchmen occupy the surrounding area.
 Champions give special quests and bonuses from towers.
