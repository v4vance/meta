Choke points for combat are important "structures".

[Choke points are rooms that contain two exits. They normally lead to rooms with three or more exits.]

Skirmishing can happen [outside the choke point] or support can be set up [outside the choke point] for
forces assaulting a nearby choke point

Castles and towers should be set up with the choke point theory in order to encourage PVP group
interaction. Solo interaction requires a "lock" setup (cornering an opponent).

Archers/ranged must shoot in straight lines with no obstruction.
