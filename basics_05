How to make money
-----

- Delivery quests
- Gathering crafting mats
- Crafting
-> Mobs should not have a bunch of gold or items on them by default
- Farming food mats

Gathering coal (example) would be an example of dwarven mining, and the 
occasional chunk of gold or gem might show up.

"Nodes" for mats may only be visible to certain gathering professions.
"Gold" is a currency insomuch as it is used for advancement of levels/skills
 and/or the procurement of items.
 
Making those goals available by other means makes gold scavenging seem less attractive.


Exploration of alternative political structures
-----

Most fantasy games show a capitalist/imperialist approach to economics and governance.

What about other types of political structures?
How would the elves govern themselves? Seems to be a rigid hierarchy based on merit/ability
 (dictated by proximity to the Powers) which in turn is genetic.
Dwarves seem more communal, with deference given to the tribal leaders (priests?)
