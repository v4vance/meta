I've personally tended to not like XP systems, and instead prefer systems where 
you "level" by actually doing. So you get better at crafting by crafting things, 
not by hitting goblins with a stick. And you get better at lockpicking by - you 
guessed it - picking locks.
Problem is that can then get grind-y itself, as you end up picking a thousand 
locks to get that little bit better, but that's just a balance thing. I played 
on a UO shard once where the rate of improvement was directly linked to the rate 
of failure. As such, picking locks that you could get every single time gave you 
no improvement, but picking locks that were really hard and you only had a 10% 
chance of success gave a huge boost. Of course, the harder it is, the more likely 
you are to damage your equipment and the more likely it is you'd be caught doing 
it, so you've got to balance those things up...
